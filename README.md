I used a Clap audio  when someone wins the game</br>
user can see whose turn is now .</br>

## Game logic:</br>
The first player will always start with X .</br>
There second Player will be O even when play with the computer it will let him play with O</br>
There is a function to check if we have a winner, consists of all the probability to win.</br>
If there is a winner will shows an alert message with clapping .</br>
when the board is full and no one reach the win positions , alert will tell the players they got a tie game(Try Again).</br>
