# **Enjoy Playing This X and O Game.**</br>

## Technology:</br>
HTML.</br>
CSS.</br>
Jquiery.</br>

## Features:</br>
I used an Clap audio  when either X or O win the Game.</br>
user can see whose turn is now .</br>

## Game logic:</br>
The first player will always start with X .</br>
There second Player will be O.</br>
There is a function to check if we have a winner, consists of all the probability to win.</br>
If there is a winner will shows an alert message with clapping .</br>
when the board is full and no one reach the win positions , alert will tell the players they got a tie game("Try Again).</br>

## Improvments: </br>
1.Online players.</br>
2.Add multiple levels.</br>
