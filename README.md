Enjoy Playing This X and O Game.

Technology:
HTML.
CSS.
Jquiery.

Features:
I used an Clap audio  when either X or O win the Game.
user can see whose turn is now .

Game logic:
The first player will always start with X .
There second Player will be O.
There is a function to check if we have a winner, consists of all the probability to win.
If there is a winner will shows an alert message with clapping .
when the board is full and no one reach the win positions , alert will tell the players they got a tie game("Try Again).

Improvments:
1.Online players.
